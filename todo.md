## To-do items for the paper and code

*   Use semiring-num
*   Tropical semirings?
*   Counting and closure and infinity.
*   Probability distribution semiring:
    *   Uses?
    *   Closure
*   Understand and apply [this MathOverflow answer](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/1651127) on convolution and Day convolution.
*   Track down references for convolution over functions with arbitrary *monoidal* domains.
    Also "convolutional algebras".
